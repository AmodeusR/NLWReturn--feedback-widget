### What I learned

Although the final result seems simple enough – just a feedback widget – it actually takes us on a long journey through many technologies, good practices and real world experience which would never be possible if not through a seemingly simple project. Nonetheless, fully complete in essentially all aspects.

Every inch of this project taught me something unique in a way or another. I had my first contact with many techs through this project – TailwindCSS, React Native, Prisma... – and reinforced others, whilst also learning about very important concepts, practices and much more about what we should do, why and how.
